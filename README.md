# Tsetlin Machine Dissertation Project
 This project can be divided into two major emphasis: Firstly, investigates building an innovative tactic for optimum pattern recognition, using tsetlin automata (Tsetlin Machine). Secondly, compares and evaluates the Tsetlin Machine against the conventionally used Multilayer Neural Network with gradient backpropagation by applying both learning techniques on four benchmark machine learning application: each exposing typical obscurities in pattern recognition algorithms.

AIMS 
The focal aim of this paper is engaged with the exploration and evaluation of the Tsetlin Machine; revealing a diverse comparison with the present traditional AI systems loosely based on a deviation of a multilayer Neural Network. Consequently, we derive a persistent question:
“ Is the Tsetlin Machine comparable to Neural networks in a suitable machine learning application? If so … Does it outrank Neural Networks?”

OBJECTIVES 
•	Comprehensive review of existing AI hardware, machine-learning techniques, and the effect of AI in the modern society and business.
•	Develop a detailed understanding of the Tsetlin Machine algorithm and energy efficiency software design principle especially in perspective to pervasive AI systems.
•	Develop an understanding of the conventionally utilized Neural Network with gradient backpropagation: considering its algorithm , its uses, and its shortcomings.
•	Research suitable and realistic metrics typically used in Machine learning evaluation with both performance and resource efficiency considered.
•	Research suitable Machine learning benchmark application for algorithm uncertainties and comparable evaluation.
•	Design and build an energy efficient software implementation with functions that emulate the key part of the algorithm of the Tsetlin Machine
•	Research suitable and comparable open source implementation of a neural network or any adaptation including the multi-layer perceptron.
•	Present a deep comparison and evaluation of the tsetlin machine implementation and the Neural Network implementation based on chosen metrics.
